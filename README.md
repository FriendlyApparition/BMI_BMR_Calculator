# BMI_BMR_Calculator
This is a Health Calculator that calculates both BMI (Body Mass Index) and BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) coded in Java.

the BMR formula used is the original imperial Harris-Benedict Equation.

I decided to build this project to practice Java fundamentals such as using classes and methods, handling in/outputs and exception handling

I also wanted to get used to using while loops in java ("do while" is new to me as I started coding seriously in python).


## About This Project:

This is the first project that I've ever posted on GitHub

I've been programming in python on and off for about two years. I'm hoping to build more consistency especially as I'm close to graduating
university

This is meant to show my growth as a developer as I keep making more projects. 

the BMICalculator.java and BMRCalculator.java are support documents used to create the method for the BMI and BMR and test them as well

UserData.java was me practicing encapsulation. I may come back to this project and see if I can implement it.

The Main file combines both calculators. you can get one or the other calculated or you could have both calculated at the same time.
After calculation, you will be asked if you would like to run through the calculations once more.

## How Does it Work?:

The main file needs both BMICalculator.java and BMRCalculator.java to work.

To have your BMI and or BMR calculated, please use an IDE that's java supported (Such as Eclipse, IntelliJ or JGRASP) and run Main.java
Follow the prompts in the console and you will be able to receive the results of your BMI and/or your BMR.

## Thank you

Thank you for reading. I'll keep trying to improve my skills as a programmer.
